# 🦾 mascot-maker

**An open-source skill that lets any coding agent design and generate animated mascots — and export them as high-quality PNG, GIF, and MP4.**

Recreate the default Claude Code mascot **Clawd**, or invent a brand-new mascot for **your own** product, brand, or platform. Install it in Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, or any agent — then just *ask*.

## Install — just tell your agent

This repo **is** a skill. Point your agent at it once, then describe the mascot
you want and it does the rest.

### 🟣 Claude Code

Tell Claude Code:

> **"Install the mascot-maker skill from https://github.com/ahkamboh/mascot-maker into my skills folder."**

…or do it by hand:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahkamboh/mascot-maker ~/.claude/skills/mascot-maker
cd ~/.claude/skills/mascot-maker && ./install.sh claude --deps
```

### 🔵 Cursor

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahkamboh/mascot-maker /tmp/mascot-maker
/tmp/mascot-maker/install.sh cursor --deps    # vendors to ./tools + writes a .cursor rule
```

### 🟢 Codex / AGENTS.md agents

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahkamboh/mascot-maker /tmp/mascot-maker
/tmp/mascot-maker/install.sh codex --deps     # vendors to ./tools + adds an AGENTS.md pointer
```

### ⚪ Any other agent (Windsurf, Cline, Aider, Continue, Zed, Gemini CLI…)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahkamboh/mascot-maker tools/mascot-maker
```
…then add one line to that agent's instruction file pointing at
`tools/mascot-maker/SKILL.md`. See [`install/other-agents.md`](install/other-agents.md).

> **One-time render dependency:** `npm install && npx playwright install chromium`
> (the `--deps` flag does this for you), plus **ffmpeg** on your `PATH`.

Then just ask:

> *"Design a mascot for my brand **Acme** — colors `#22D3EE` on `#0F172A`, it's a
> developer tool. Give me png, gif, and mp4."*

The agent reads `SKILL.md`, runs the workflow, and drops the assets in `assets/`.

## Try it in 30 seconds (no agent needed)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ahkamboh/mascot-maker && cd mascot-maker
npm install && npx playwright install chromium     # ffmpeg must be on PATH

# render the bundled mascots in all three formats
node scripts/render.mjs --input examples/clawd.html --name clawd --selector .stage --duration 5000
node scripts/render.mjs --input examples/dash.html  --name dash  --selector .stage --duration 4200

# make your own
cp templates/stage.html my-mascot.html             # edit poses + brand colors
node scripts/render.mjs --input my-mascot.html --name my-mascot --selector .stage --duration 4680
```

## What you get

| Format | Best for |
|--------|----------|
| **PNG** | README badges, favicons, app icons, social cards |
| **GIF** | GitHub READMEs, tweets, Slack, Discord |
| **MP4** | landing pages, ads, slide decks, anywhere |

The medium is **Unicode Block Elements** (`█ ▀ ▄ ▌ ▐ ▛ ▜ ▙ ▟ …`) — the same
characters Clawd is made of — rendered on a branded stage, captured frame-by-frame
by headless Chromium, and encoded with ffmpeg.

```

```

## Design rules (the short version)

1. **Stay inside Block Elements** (`U+2580–U+259F`). They tile seamlessly. Don't
   mix in geometric shapes `◢◣◤◥` — they cause seams.
2. **Test-render at your real font size.** 48–88px on a 600px stage is the sweet
   spot; ~110px breaks half-blocks.
3. **One clear silhouette, internal motion.** Keep the outline stable; animate
   the eye / arms / mouth / thrust.
4. **For a brand mascot, don't clone Clawd.** Steal the brand's colors and tone;
   pick your own body (orb, drop, arrow, flame, fox, comet, rocket).
5. **`--duration` = sum of your sequence ms** → seamless loops.
